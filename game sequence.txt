game sequence:

click anywhere -> turn off global event listener


next:
generate next color
add to sequence
play sequence
pause
add button event listeners


wait for user button clicks


if clicked button matches next in sequence then continue waiting
if not then change h1 and end game

once len(clickedList) == len(sequence)
next level


try to sort the issue where the button listeners are enabled before playSequence is finished
